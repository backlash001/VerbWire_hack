# MedSecure Blockchain medical Application

## This project is a medical blockchain application focussed on improving the security of patient's info and providing a solution against hospital hacks by making the entire system on blockchain and thereby making is safe and secure and most importantly anonymous!!

### 1. Upload a local file to IPFS 
     Api was used to upload medical records to ipfs while booking doctor appointments.

# The problem MED-Secure solves
# Med-Secure revolutionizes healthcare by offering a secure, transparent, and anonymous ecosystem. Here's how Med-Secure transforms healthcare:

# 1. Data Security and Anonymity:
Utilizes the inherent security of blockchain to safeguard patient data. Medical records are stored on the IPFS and encrypted, ensuring patient anonymity and eliminating the risk of data breaches.

# 2. Efficient Booking and Appointment Management:
Facilitate seamless appointment booking, reducing waiting times, and streamlining healthcare access.

# 3. Transparent Reviews and Feedback:
Patients can provide feedback and reviews only to doctors who are responsible for their treatment. This fosters a transparent and accountable doctor-patient relationship, improving trust in the healthcare system.

# 4. Verified Doctors with Ethical Data Handling:
Ensures that only verified doctors are added to the platform. Hospital owners carefully vet doctors' credentials before onboarding them. During treatment, doctors have temporary access to patient history, promoting ethical data handling.

# 5. Seamless Information Transfer:
Patients can securely share medical records through IPFS, allowing them to seek a second opinion or transfer care while maintaining data integrity and privacy.

# 6. Portable Medical Records:
Enables seamless and secure transfer of medical records, ensuring continuity of care, regardless of location or healthcare provider.

# 7. Enhanced Patient Privacy:
Blockchain's immutable nature and cryptographic security ensure patient data remains private, reducing the risk of identity theft or unauthorized access.

# 8. Empowering Patient Control:
Med-Secure empowers patients to take control of their healthcare data. They can manage access permissions and share information selectively with trusted healthcare providers.


# Challenges we ran into

## Med-Secure faces several challenges that require careful consideration and solutions for successful implementation:

## Limited Availability of Doctors: Ensuring a sufficient number of doctors on the platform is crucial to provide comprehensive healthcare services. Attracting and onboarding qualified medical professionals is a top priority.

## Slow Testnet: The slow performance of the testnet can hinder smooth operations and user experience. Optimizing the platform's performance and exploring alternative testnets can address this issue.

## No Testnet Token: The absence of a testnet token makes it difficult for users to explore and test the platform without using real Ether. Introducing a testnet token can encourage user engagement and testing.

## Issues with Ether.js and thirdweb.js: The use of Ether.js and thirdweb.js libraries may lead to compatibility and functionality issues. Regular updates and collaboration with the library maintainers are vital to resolving these problems.
